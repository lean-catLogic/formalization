# Formalization
Formalization of Categorical Logic in the Lean proof assistant. For more details on the project, visit [the documentation website](https://lean-catLogic.github.io)

## Directories
- [Category Theory](src/categoryTheory): Implementation of category-theoretic structures more suited to the purposes of categorical logic
- [Deduction](src/deduction): Formal systems and proof calculi
- [Semantics](src/semantics): interpreting formal languages in mathematical structures, such as posets, categories, and Kripke models
